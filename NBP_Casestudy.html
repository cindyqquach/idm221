      <h2> OVERVIEW  </h2>
      <p> Website redesign for North Bowl Philly - a retro-chic bowling alley that offers food, alcohol bar, bowling leagues, and private and public events, located in North East Philadelphia, PA. 
    </p> 
      <p> The scope of this assignment is to learn how to conduct user and business research and design both aesthetically pleasing and functional user interfaces.

      <h2> CHALLENGES AND GOALS </h2>
      <p> The goal for this project is to create an intuitive website for an engaging and seamless customer experience, leading to an increase in sales and customers to the business. I also want to bring North Bowl Philly’s spirit, which is upbeat, into the website’s visual interface by re-establishing its color palette and adding more photos to help customers visualize what services they can get at North Bowl Philly. 
    </p>
      <p> As the website appeals to a wide range of audiences, I find it challenging to exude North Bowl Philly’s party, vibrant personality while showcasing its neutral, easy-to-read visuals catering for older generations.
    </p>

    <div class="para"> 
      <h2> PROCESS AND INSIGHTS </h2>
      <p> I started by examining the original North Bowl Philly’s website to see its strengths and weaknesses. Having an established branding and sufficient service information are the website’s strengths. In contrast, North Bowl Philly’s website lacks: 
    </p>
          <div>
              <ul> 
                  <li> <span class="italic">An online booking portal,</span> though it states that bowling lanes are first come, first served. 
                </li>
                  <li ><span class="italic">An efficient navigation bar. </span> Some tabs (About, Leagues) can’t be found on its navigation bar or front page.
                </li>
              </ul>

          </div> 
    </div>
    <div> 
        <p>I started researching North Bowl Philly's target customers. Their target audience is young people from nearby colleges that hang out with their friends or family, professional bowler, or colleagues at their company party. People coming to the website would most likely seek North Bowl Philly's bowling price, opening hours, food and drinks menu, booking or private events reservations. 
        </p> 
        <p> Next, I did an open card sorting exercise on three people who fit North Bowl Philly's target audience. Two of them are college students who occasionally enjoy bowling with their friends and family. One of them is also a bowling enthusiast who is recently interested in partaking in leagues. The other regularly goes bowling with their colleagues as part of their company's activities. 
        </p>
        <p> Viewing the result analysis, I noticed that all three participants agreed on grouping cards of food and drinks offers together. Events, live music, open leagues information, and their sub-content are grouped into the same category. General information such as 'About us,' 'Hours and Location,' 'Social media links,' and 'Pricing' is in the same category for all three people. These are the information visitors would first look for on a site. Although they are all informational cards, they don't belong to the same type of information; therefore, I decided to put them into the navigation. Two participants told me they were having trouble sorting the 'gift card' and 'job application' cards as they didn't seem to belong to any categories. Therefore, these two cards should stand on their own, respectively. 
        </p>
<!---------<img src="heuristics map.png">
           <img src="graph.png">-->
        <p>Participants suggested including a 'Policy' page and 'Player's review' of the sites. They recalled having to follow several policies on food, drinks, and lane reservations from their previous bowling alley experience; posting these regulations on their website will warn customers of these policies ahead of time. Including a Reviews section or positive feedback from previous players to the website will make it more user-friendly, reflecting North Bowl Philly's core values. These two concepts are appealing to me, so I've included them in my new sitemap. I also added a 'Reserve a lane' feature to this website to satisfy customers' online booking needs.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the before and after sitemap.</p> 
<!---------<img src="beforesitemap.png">
           <img src="aftersitemap.png">-->
        <p>Next, with the results from my previous research, I decided to sketch out some wireframes of the front page, the Events and Leagues page, and a content-heavy page, which is the Menu. After a critique session with my professor and classmates, I decided to go with these wireframes as it solves all previous problems and includes visual elements that can transcribe North Bowl Philly's funky, pop atmosphere.         </p> 
        <p>In my next step, I reevaluate and establish the website's color palette. North Bowl Philly's original color palette is already reflective of the bowling alley's branding, which is retro-chic. However, as I look into some more pages on the site, the physical bowling alley seems more vibrant and upbeat. That's why I decided to bring saturation and contrast to its current colors.         </p>
